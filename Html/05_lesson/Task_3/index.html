                <p>Highway Traffic game is centered around driving down the highway, dodging other cars, and avoiding
                    accidents. It gets tricky because other vehicles are slowing down, speeding up or stopping abruptly,
                    so you always have to keep your attention and be ready to make a quick maneuver.
